              Marketing Specialist and Front-End-Developer based in Germany.
            </h2>
            <p>
              I have started my coding journey in January 2021 with SheCodes. It
              has been a pleasure to learn from the workshops and I have been
              able to apply my newly gained skills directly and practically
              completing the homework and projects. </br>
              Learing to code has been something 
              I've been wanting to do for a while and in a world, where everything is becoming 
              digital, I felt it was an essential step to take.

              My journey so far
            </h2>
            <p>
              I grew up in Germany and had many different hobbies as a child, including ballet dancing,
              singing, theater and horseback riding. </br> 
              At the age of 16 I started attending boarding school
              in Surrey, UK, which allowed me to gain many important soft skills, like working independently, 
              time management and discipline. </br>
              I stayed in the UK after completing my IB Diploma and successfully studied Business Management with Marketing,
              a subject I chose to gain a better understanding of how companies work. Marketing was of special
              interest to me, because it unites creativity and analytics, which I both enjoy.
